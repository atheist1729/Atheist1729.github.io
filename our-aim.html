    <h1>Our Aim</h1>
    <p class="scroll-animate">Our mission is simple: to create an education system that fosters creativity, mental well-being, and future-ready skills, preparing students for the challenges of tomorrow.</p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">1. No Data Collected Yet, But We Need Your Help!</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">We are still in the process of conducting the survey and haven't gathered the data yet. To make this survey effective, we need at least 1 lakh responses. <strong>More responses mean more power to push for meaningful reforms.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">2. Moving Beyond Rote Learning</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">The current education system prioritizes memorization over understanding. This needs to change. We want a system that nurtures critical thinking, encourages curiosity, and values creativity.</p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">3. Reimagining Assessments</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">Our surveys show that assessments often fail to measure true understanding. We need new forms of assessments that promote problem-solving and real-world application of knowledge.</p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">4. Promoting Mental Health and Well-being</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">Students are under immense pressure. We aim to reduce stress through balanced education that promotes mental and emotional health alongside academic success.</p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">5. Integrating Technology</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">With the rapid development of technology, our education system needs to keep up. Our goal is to integrate the latest tools and technologies to prepare students for future careers.</p>

    <h2 class="scroll-animate">6. Ensuring Accessibility for All</h2>
    <p class="scroll-animate">Our education system must be inclusive, ensuring all students, regardless of socio-economic status, have equal access to opportunities. This includes better support for underrepresented groups and remote areas.</p>
