      <h1>Our Aim</h1>
      <p>Our mission is simple: to create an education system that fosters creativity, mental well-being, and future-ready skills, preparing students for the challenges of tomorrow.</p>

      <h2>1. No Data Collected Yet, But We Need Your Help!</h2>
      <p>We are still in the process of conducting the survey and haven't gathered the data yet. To make this survey effective, we need at least 1 lakh responses. <strong>More responses mean more power to push for meaningful reforms.</strong></p>

      <h2>2. Moving Beyond Rote Learning</h2>
      <p>The current education system prioritizes memorization over understanding. This needs to change. We want a system that nurtures critical thinking, encourages curiosity, and values creativity.</p>

      <h2>3. Reimagining Assessments</h2>
      <p>Our surveys show that assessments often fail to measure true understanding. We need new forms of assessments that promote problem-solving and real-world application of knowledge.</p>

      <h2>4. Promoting Mental Health and Well-being</h2>
      <p>Students are under immense pressure. We aim to reduce stress through balanced education that promotes mental and emotional health alongside academic success.</p>

      <h2>5. Integrating Technology</h2>
      <p>With the rapid development of technology, our education system needs to keep up. Our goal is to integrate the latest tools and technologies to prepare students for future careers.</p>

      <h2>6. Ensuring Accessibility for All</h2>
      <p>Our education system must be inclusive, ensuring all students, regardless of socio-economic status, have equal access to opportunities. This includes better support for underrepresented groups and remote areas.</p>
